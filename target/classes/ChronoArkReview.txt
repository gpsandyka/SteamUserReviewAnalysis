Game is fun, but it's a bit hard because of several things:
1. You get a lot of unidentified items you have to identify with another item, but the ratio you get unidentified items vs scrolls to identify is less than 10:1, meaning you get useless items, or random stuff happens when you use the items
2. Some things are badly translated or not well explained at all, like why when I use a fixed ability, some other fixed abilities are unusable and some aren't?
3. Boss mechanics are not clear at all

Too hard and too long. It takes 2+ hours to complete a game, so it is very very annoying if you struggle (and are lucky) to reach the final area but fail finally. By the way, by the time I write this review, at most 7% of the players have completed the game and only 1.6% have completed the expert difficulty.

Also, the relics need more balancing. For example, there is a relic that prevents you from being killed by pain damage, but such situation happens rarely. On the other hand, there is a relic that increases your speed. This relic is very useful because it helps you kill enemies before their actions.

What the hell !!

WHY enemy have the other action counter.

You give me a map but i have no chose, i just only need to finish all map item.
I don't want to waste time to search BORING map.

I don't know why cost increase but i only have 3 mana at the beginning.

Actually, i 'd rather to buy 10 times slay the spire instead of this game.

Sadly this game enjoyment does not last... Tried 2 times with 2nd boss: the doll getting beaten up over and over again.
1) It has curse which makes you choose which character to take dmg
2) summon 2 monsters per 2/3 turns...
3) may require more time to unlock more dmg or so which I felt unnecessary...

Over all grind it as you will but I rather have some tactics to deal with boss not op items and stuff
